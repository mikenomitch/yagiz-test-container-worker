# Container Worker Starter

This is a basic repo for Yagiz to test DO-Container methods

## Prerequisites

1. Make sure Docker is installed, and the Docker daemon is running

## Steps

1. Make sure you have a Cloudflare token with Workers and Containers access

2. Clone this repo, and cd into it

3. Wrangler deploy

`wrangler deploy`

4. See the dashboard for status.

5. Access your Worker URL and go use some Containers

### Notes on Setup

* Currently there is an awkward waiting period on your first deploy, we should figure out a nice way to explain this in the dash/first worker code
